# Iterating the vanishing lemma to order `2p`: the moment bound for the fluctuation average

The paper (arXiv:2503.07606) does not state these lemmas: the estimates on `G_t` "follow that of
Lemma 4.2 in [YY_25], which is dimension-independent" (Section "Estimates for entries of `G`"),
and the fluctuation averaging behind (`GavLGEX`) is proved internally.  The declarations are the
iteration to order `2p`, `FlucGainUpTo'`, `integral_norm_flucAvg_pow_le_iter_budget` and what
they need.

Everything lives at one slice `n` of a size sequence `d : Sizes`, on the fine index
`Idx (d.L n) (d.W n) = Z2 (W L)`, with `E_k = condRow d n k` and the variance `svar`.
`flucDiag`, `flucAvg`, `epsHom`, `UniformWeight`, `uniformWeight_svar`,
`uniformWeight_blockAvg2` are those of `RBM2D/Green/FlucVanish.lean`, the measurability
and the envelopes those of `RBM2D/Green/FlucAvg.lean`; `FinDep` is that of
`RBM2D/Green/LDEQuad.lean` and `finDep_of_Hflow` that of `RBM2D/Green/GreenDeriv.lean`.
Nothing is redefined.

## What is proved

1. **Conditional expectations over different rows commute** (`condRow_condRow_comm`), by
   generalizing `rowSplit` to an arbitrary decidable set of coordinates (`predSplit`).  No
   disjointness is needed: the rows `k` and `κ` share the entry `H_{kκ}`.
2. **The iteration** (`norm_integral_prod_applyOps_le_graded`,
   `norm_integral_prod_qRow_le_graded`, `norm_integral_prod_epsHom_flucDiag_le_budget`).  The
   state is a word `L i` of operators `P_κ = E_κ` and `Q_κ = 1 - E_κ` per slot (`applyOps`, a
   `List (Bool × Idx)`, head outermost); the invariant `OpsOkOut` says every word uses pairwise
   distinct rows of slots already pivoted, different from its own slot's row.  One step picks a
   pivot `i₀` whose row is **lone**, writes `1 = Q_{k i₀} + P_{k i₀}` in every other slot
   (`prod_eq_sum_pivotFam`), discards the all-`P` term, which vanishes by
   `integral_mul_prod_eq_zero`, and recurses.  Each surviving term has **one more `Q`**,
   which is where the extra power of the gain comes from.  At full depth the bound is
   `(2 max(1,ρ))^{(#ι-1) r} ρ^r B^{#ι}` with `r` the number of lone slots pivoted.
3. **The counting** (`two_mul_card_image_le_add_card_loneSlots`, `card_filter_card_image_le`,
   `sum_prod_abs_card_image_le`, `sum_weighted_le`): a multi-index with `a` lone slots has at
   most `(n + a)/2` distinct values, so the weight of its stratum is at most `n^n ρ^{n-a}` once
   `c ≤ ρ²`; with the `ρ^a` of the iteration this is `ρ^n` for **every** stratum.
4. **The moment bound** (`integral_norm_flucAvg_pow_le_iter_budget`):

     `E|∑_k t_k Z_k|^{2p} ≤ (2p+1)(2p)^{2p} (2^{2p-1} ρ B)^{2p}`

   for every uniform weight `t` (`UniformWeight T c A`, `c ≤ ρ²`, `ρ ≤ 1`, `2p ≤ #A`), given the
   gain interface `FlucGainUpTo' d n u z m B ρ M K` with `2p ≤ M`, `2p ≤ K`.  With `ρ, B ≍ Ψ`
   this is `flucAvg ≺ Ψ²`.

## d = 2

The moment bound is stated for a uniform weight with value `c` on a set `A`.  The two families of
the d = 2 model are the theorems `uniformWeight_svar` (the row `j ↦ S_{ij}`,
`c = (5W²)⁻¹`, `#A = 5W²` for `3 ≤ L`) and `uniformWeight_blockAvg2` (the block average,
`c = W⁻²`, `#A = W²`), in place of the d = 1 `(3W)⁻¹`, `W⁻¹`.  The threshold `c ≤ ρ²` reads
`ρ ≥ (5W²)^{-1/2}` resp. `ρ ≥ W⁻¹`, and `2p ≤ #A` holds eventually since `W → ∞`
(`tendsto_W`).  No union bound over the `N = (WL)²` sites is used in this file: it enters at the
`≺` consumers.

## The gain interface

`FlucGainUpTo' d n u z m B ρ M K` is the **higher-order minor expansion**: applying `q ≤ M`
conditional fluctuations `Q_{κ_1} ⋯ Q_{κ_q}` (distinct rows, all different from `k`) to `Z_k`
gains a factor `ρ^q`, for at most `K` slots.  It is a *hypothesis* of the moment bound, supplied
by the consumers (the local law), not a theorem here.  It is not vacuous: it holds gain-free
(`ρ` compensated by `B`) for words bounded crudely by `norm_applyOps_le`.

## Notation

* The slice is `n` and the budget of `FlucGainUpTo'` is `K`; the objects are `Sizes`,
  `Idx (d.L n) (d.W n)`, `Sizes.SeqΩ d`, `Sizes.seqP d`, `Sizes.SeqCoord d`, `spectralZ E t`,
  `spectralM E`.
* `[DecidableEq ι]` is not assumed in `OpsOkOut.length_le`,
  `norm_integral_prod_applyOps_le_graded` and `norm_integral_prod_qRow_le_graded` (their proofs
  use `classical`).

/-! ### Splitting along an arbitrary set of coordinates

`RBM2D/Green/CondRow.lean` splits a sample point along the coordinates of one row (`rowSplit`).
The iteration needs several rows at once, and — more importantly — it needs to know that the
resulting conditional expectations **commute**.  Both come from one generalization: replace the
predicate `IsRowCoord d n k` by an arbitrary decidable predicate on coordinates. -/

/-- `predSplit d p ω ω'` takes the coordinates satisfying `p` from `ω'` and the rest from `ω`.

/-! ### The iteration

The induction is on the number of **pivots still to be performed**.  The state is a family of
words `L i`, one per slot; the invariant is that every word is admissible outside the set `R` of
remaining pivots.  One step picks a pivot `i₀ ∈ R`, expands `1 = Q_{k i₀} + P_{k i₀}` in every
other slot, discards the all-`P` term (it vanishes) and recurses on `R.erase i₀` with the words
lengthened by one letter.  Each surviving term has at least one more `Q`, which is where the
extra factor `ρ` comes from; after `#ι` pivots the bound carries `ρ^{#ι}` on top of the trivial
`B^{#ι}`, i.e. `Ψ^{4p}` when `#ι = 2p` and `B, ρ ≍ Ψ`. -/

/-! ### Counting multi-indices by the number of lone slots

The multi-indices are split by the *number* of their lone slots, not only by whether there is
one: that number is the number of pivots available, hence the power of the gain.  The counting
input is that a value taken by a non-lone slot uses up at least two slots, so

  `2 · #(image v) ≤ #ι + #(lone slots of v)`. -/

/-! ### The stratified weight sum

With the per-multi-index bound `K^a ρ^a B^n` (`a` = number of lone slots) in hand, the sum over
multi-indices weighted by `∏_i |t_{v i}|` is stratified by `a`.  A multi-index with `a` lone
slots has at most `(n + a)/2` distinct values, so its weight is `c^n` times a count of at most
`(#A)^{(n+a)/2} · n^n`; since `c · #A ≤ 1` and `c ≤ ρ²`, the weight of the stratum is at
most `n^n ρ^{n-a}`, and the `ρ^a` of the iteration completes it to `ρ^n`.  **This is why the
iteration gives `Ψ^{4p}`**: with `c ≍ Ψ²` (so `ρ ≍ Ψ`) and `B ≍ Ψ`, the bound is
`C_n (B ρ)^n = C_p Ψ^{4p}`. -/

/-! ### The length-graded iteration

The words the iteration builds carry one letter per pivot, the pivots are lone slots, so the
words have length at most `#ι = 2p`; the induction invariant `OpsOkOut` already *says* so
(`OpsOkOut.length_le`), and no extra length bookkeeping has to be threaded through the
iteration.  The gain hypothesis `hgain` below is therefore only asked for words of length
`≤ #ι`. -/

/-- **The induction invariant bounds the length.**  A word admissible outside `R` uses
pairwise distinct rows, each the row of a slot outside `R`; the slots realizing them are
therefore distinct, so the word has at most `#ι - #R` letters.  In particular a word arising in
`norm_integral_prod_applyOps_le_graded` never has more than `#ι` letters (`#ι = 2p` at
`ι = Fin p ⊕ Fin p`), which is why the gain interface only ever needs to hold up to that length. -/

/-! ### The gain interface and the moment bound

`FlucGainUpTo'` asks for the higher-order minor expansion for words of length `≤ M` **and** for
at most `K` slots.  The second budget is not cosmetic: without it, `ι = Fin j`, every word empty
and every pivot equal to a single `k` are admissible, the gain exponent is `0`, and the interface
would read `∫ ‖Z_k‖^j ≤ B^j` for **every** `j`, i.e. an `L^∞` bound `‖Z_k‖ ≤ B`.  The `2p`-th
moment expansion instantiates the interface at `ι = Fin p ⊕ Fin p` and nowhere else, so
`#ι = 2p`, exactly as `OpsOkOut.length_le` makes the words have length `≤ 2p`; both budgets are
`2p` and the consumers ask for `M = K = 2p`. -/

section Budget

/-- **The gain interface with both budgets.**  `M` budgets the length of the words, `K` the
number of slots `#ι`; the `2p`-th moment expansion has `M = K = 2p`.  The words `L i` use

/-- **The moment bound for the fluctuation average.**  For a uniform weight `T` (value `c ≤ ρ²`
on a set `A` with `2p ≤ #A`) and `ρ ≤ 1`,
`E|∑_k T_k Z_k|^{2p} ≤ (2p+1)(2p)^{2p} (2^{2p-1} ρ B)^{2p}`.  The `2p`-th moment uses the
interface at `#ι = 2p` slots and words of length `≤ 2p`, so `M = K = 2p` suffices. -/
