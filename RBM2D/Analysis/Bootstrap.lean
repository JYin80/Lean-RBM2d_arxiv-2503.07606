# Continuous induction (the bootstrap argument)

A self-improving bound propagates along an interval: if `φ` is continuous on `[a, b]`, starts
below `B`, and *every* point where `φ ≤ C` already satisfies `φ ≤ B` (with `B < C`), then
`φ ≤ B` on all of `[a, b]`.

This is the analytic core of the two-dimensional paper's §5 Step 2. It replaces the
stopping-time step around (124): once the quantity being bootstrapped is a
*deterministic continuous* function of the time (a moment `φ(u) = E[(J*_{u,D})^q]` rather than a
path), no optional stopping is needed — the set where the improved bound holds is open and
closed in `[a, b]`, hence everything.

Nothing here is specific to the model, and nothing outside Mathlib is used.

## Main statements

* `le_of_bootstrap` : `[a, b]` version, self-improvement `φ u ≤ C → φ u ≤ B` with `B < C`
* `le_of_bootstrap_prefix` : the self-improvement may use the bound on all of `[a, u]`
* `le_of_bootstrap_two_mul` : the common shape, `C = 2 * B` with `0 < B`

/-- **Continuous induction.**  If `φ` is continuous on `[a, b]`, `φ a ≤ B`, `B < C`, and at every
point of `[a, b]` the bound `φ u ≤ C` improves itself to `φ u ≤ B`, then `φ ≤ B` on `[a, b]`.

The set `{u | φ u ≤ B}` equals `{u | φ u < C}` by self-improvement, so it is at once closed and
open in `[a, b]`; it contains `a`, and `[a, b]` is connected. -/

/-- **Continuous induction, prefix form.**  The self-improvement may use the a priori bound on
the whole initial segment `[a, u]`, not just at `u`: this is the shape of the paper's Step 2,
where "assume `J*_{v,D} ≤ (η_s/η_t)⁴` for all `v ≤ u`" improves the bound at `u`.

Let `s` be the supremum of the times up to which `φ ≤ B` holds.  Continuity gives `φ s ≤ B`,
so the bound holds on `[a, s]`; if `s < b`, continuity gives `φ < C` slightly beyond `s`, and
the self-improvement then upgrades it to `φ ≤ B` there, contradicting the supremum. -/
