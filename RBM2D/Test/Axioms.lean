# Axiom audit: the `#assert_rbm_axioms` command

`#assert_rbm_axioms` walks every declaration in the namespace `RBM` visible in the current
environment, collects the axioms it depends on (the same computation as `#print axioms`), and
**fails** unless all of them are among `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.  In
particular any `sorry` (`sorryAx`) or user-declared `axiom` anywhere in the `RBM` namespace breaks
the build.  It also fails if it finds fewer than `100` declarations, so that a mistyped
namespace cannot make the audit pass vacuously.

There is deliberately **no allow-list beyond the three**: every statement that is not proved is
carried as an explicit hypothesis, a theorem parameter or a `structure` field, never as an
`axiom`.
