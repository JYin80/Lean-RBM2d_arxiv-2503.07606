# Axiom audit: the `#assert_rbm_axioms` command

`#assert_rbm_axioms` walks every declaration in the namespace `RBM` visible in the current
environment, collects the axioms it depends on (the same computation as `#print axioms`), and
**fails** unless all of them are among `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.  In
particular any `sorry` (`sorryAx`) or project `axiom` anywhere in the `RBM` namespace breaks
the build.  It also fails if it finds fewer than `100` declarations, so that a renamed
namespace cannot make the audit pass vacuously.

There is deliberately **no allow-list beyond the three**.  Everything Section 8 needs and
Mathlib does not have -- the per-annulus estimate `(eq_dyadic)`, the contour shift, the
two-dimensional logarithmic integral -- is carried as a `structure` field or a theorem
parameter (`Propagator/Dyadic.lean`, `Propagator/ContourInterface.lean`), never as an
`axiom`.  That is what lets this audit stay at exactly three names while the interfaces are
still open, and it is why replacing a field by a theorem later changes nothing here.
